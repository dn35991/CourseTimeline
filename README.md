# Course Timeline Project

To begin using this code, create a file called "personal.py" where you must declare the variables "HOST_NAME", "USERNAME", and "PASSWORD" in the exact format and fill in each variable with string of your MySQL Workbench host name, username, and password respectively.
Then in the command line, execute the "database_init.py" to initialize the database and tables. Now, you can execute the "add_course_info.py" file and "read.py" file.
